## 🌍 Internet Connection Requirement
- The **weather API** requires an active internet connection to fetch real-time temperature and humidity data.
- If the API is unavailable, the system may not function correctly.

---

## 📌 Notes
- Ensure that all dependencies are installed properly.
- If you face issues with the API, check your internet connection and API key.
- You can modify the `config.py` file to use a different API source.
